# Space-Time Cube README

## Description
Space-Time Cube is a zSpace program that displays a visualization of spatio-temporal data (data that consists of both location and time). It does so by plotting points within a 3D cube, where the forward-back and left-right axes shows the position of the data point, and the up-down axis shows the time of the data point.

## Setup
This program requires a working zSpace setup. Everything else should already be configured correctly.
