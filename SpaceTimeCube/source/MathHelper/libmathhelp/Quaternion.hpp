/* DESCRIPTION
    Quaternions are the preferred method of performing rotational interpolation,
    and for performing calculations between angles. (say, combining them)
    Quaternions don't suffer from gimbal lock (unlike Euler angles), and provide
    smooth interpolations, unlike rotation matrices.

    Interpolation is provided by Spherical Linear intERPolation (slerp).

    The proper order is:

    1) Convert Euler angles to quaternions

    2) Perform whatever calculations are needed (such as slerp)

    3) Convert the resulting quaternions to rotation matrixes

    4) Rotate points using the matrixes.

    Many of these functions were adapted from the Allegro Gaming Library, and
    from the Math and Quaternion FAQ.
